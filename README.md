# reverse-zMAP

reverse-zMAP module is primarily designed for handling MS runs with relatively large sample sizes. 
 In practice,large-scale proteomic studies have frequently applied the strategy of adding a biologically identical
 reference sample to each individual MS run. For example, in cancer studies, a mixed sample is typically
 generated by pooling tumor samples and/or normal adjacent tissues (NATs) from several related patients
 in equal protein amounts. The proteome of this mixed sample is then profiled in every MS run separately.
 reverse-zMAP module alleviates the influence of outliers by repeatedly making pairwise comparisons, which
 in the meanwhile allows the modeling of sample-specific mean-variance trend, but it requires a biologically
 identical reference sample in each MS run for a subsequent integration across MS runs.

# Usage

## reverse-zMAP
reverse-zMAP models the mean-variance dependence associated with ILMS intensities and accordingly applies a variance-stabilizing z-transformation (z-statistic), 
which dramatically increases the comparability between samples generated by different MS runs. The z-statistic can be widely applied in downstream analyses.

Two input files provided by user:

1. Protein intensity file
   
    A tab-delimited file containing raw gene-level protein intensity with samples in columns, and gene symbols in rows.
Note:(1). The protein intensity matrix does not require normalization.(2). Sample names can only consist of letters, numbers, and underscores.

2. Sample information file

    Sample information file is a four-column, tab-delimited file with the first line identifying the columns. The column names are ```Sample_id```, ```MS_run```, ```Sample_condition```, and ```internal_ref```.

Use the command shown as below:

```bat
python $scriptPATH/reverse_zmap.py --intensity_data $inputdataPATH/small_data_protein_level_intensity.txt --sample_information $inputdataPATH/small_data_sample_info_add_internal_ref.txt --outdir $inputdataPATH/reverse_zMAP_results --window_size 400 --step_size 100 --percent 50 --method natural_cubic_spline
```
## Downstream analyses based on z-statistic

### Sample Quality Control

Performing principal component and hierarchical clustering analysis on the z-statistic matrix of samples provides a concise visualization of the overall impact of sample conditions and MS runs.

```

### sample subgrouping

For delineating molecular subtypes at the protein level, this function is designed to select a subset of hypervariable proteins across samples. 
It then undertakes unsupervised clustering on the samples, offering quantitative evidence to ascertain both the number and composition of potential
 clusters within the dataset. For in-depth algorithmic insights, please consult the details provided in Consensus Clustering and R package ```ConsensusClusterPlus```.

Two input files provided by user:

1. Output file z_statistic_table.txt from reverse-zMAP

2. Sample information file

    Sample information file is a three-column, tab-delimited file with the first line identifying the columns. The column names are ```Sample_id```, ```Sample_condition```, and ```MS_run```.
   
Parameters:

1. Sample condition (```--sample_condition```)

   Perform clustering on specific condition of samples.

2. Top N(number) hypervariable proteins for subgrouping (```--top_n```)

   Proteins were ranked based on their variance across samples, and the z-statistic matrices of the top_n proteins were used for clustering. By default, the top_n is set to 3000.


Use the command shown as below:
```bat
python $scriptPATH/SampleSubgrouping.py --z_statistic_matrix $inputdataPATH/cervical_cancer_z_statistic.txt --sample_info $inputdataPATH/cervical_cancer_sample_info.txt --sample_condition Tumor_tissue --outdir $inputdataPATH/SampleSubgrouping --top_n 3000
```

### Gene set variation analysis
GSVA calculates gene set enrichment scores (GSVA scores) for each sample using the z-statistic matrix.
Differential expression analysis is then conducted on these GSVA scores using limma, aiming to identify differentially regulated pathways across sample groups. Finally, the differential pathway activities across sample groups are visualized using a heatmap.

### Association with clinical and molecular features
Samples were grouped using the z-statistic matrix derived from HVPs, with the aim of correlating proteomic subgroups
 to clinical and molecular features.We employed either the Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test to examine the association
 between proteomic subgroups and discrete sample features, selecting the appropriate test based on the number of categories
 within each feature. For continuous features, we utilized Studentâ€™s t-test or ANOVA.

ANOVA was further applied to identify differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) among sample groups.
Subsequently, hierarchical clustering of proteins, driven by the z-statistic matrix, revealed distinctive
expression signatures. Finally, pathway enrichment analysis was conducted for each set of proteins.

### Association with mutation data

To pick out the proteins that were associated with non-silent somatic mutations, QTL analysis is used. 
Somatic mutations detected in at least 10 more samples are included in the analysis (Users determine based on the number of samples). 
Then, we pick out the proteins whose expression was detected in at least half of the tumor samples. 
Finally, for each candidate gene-protein pair, we performed a regression of the protein expression 
against the mutation status of the gene using MatrixEQTL R package, by fitting the following linear 
model: Y = Î± + Î²X + Î³S + Î´A+Îµ. Here, Y was a vector of the z-statistics of the protein in tumor samples; 
X was the non-silent somatic mutation indicators of the gene; S and A referred to the sex and age variables, 
respectively, as well as other control variables; Îµ was a vector of independent and identically distributed 
noise variables; Î±, Î², Î³, and Î´ were unknown parameters. This model was fitted by applying the least squares method,
 and the null hypothesis Î²=0 was then tested by applying the t-test.
